# Medusa E-commerce Project Daily Progress

This project is based on the **Medusa** headless commerce platform, designed to build customizable and scalable e-commerce solutions. 
Daily tasks and updates will be added inside the project folder as we work through various stages of development.

## About Medusa

modern, customized commerce experiences, integrating seamlessly with third-party services.
