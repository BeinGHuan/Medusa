# Basics to know before heading into moving onto the daily tasks

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. *A GitHub Account*:
   - Ensure you have a GitHub account. If not, [sign up for free](https://github.com/join).

2. *A GitHub Repository*:
   - You should have a repository where you want to create the folder. You can create a new repository or use an existing one.

3. *Git Installed Locally (for Local Method)*:
   - If you are using the local method, make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

4. *Git Configuration (for Local Method)*:
   - Ensure your Git is configured with your user details. You can configure Git with:
     bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
     

### Method 1: Create a Folder Directly on GitHub

1. *Go to Your Repository*:
   - Open your GitHub repository where you want to create the folder.

2. *Create a New File*:
   - Click on the *"Add file"* button at the top-right corner of the repository page.
   - Select *"Create new file"*.

3. *Specify the Folder Name*:
   - In the "Name your file..." field, type the folder name followed by a / and the name of the file you want to create inside the folder. For example: new-folder/readme.md.
   - This will create a folder named new-folder and a file named readme.md inside it.

4. *Commit the Changes*:
   - Add a commit message in the "Commit new file" section.
   - Choose whether to commit to the main branch or create a new branch.
   - Click *"Commit new file"*.

> *Note*: GitHub does not allow creating empty folders. You need to create at least one file in the folder. To keep an empty folder, you can create a placeholder file such as .gitkeep or .readme. 

---

### Method 2: Create a Folder Using Git (Locally)

1. *Navigate to Your Repository*:
   - Open a terminal or Git Bash.
   - Navigate to your repositoryâ€™s directory using:
     bash
     cd path/to/your/repository
     

2. *Create a Folder Locally*:
   - Create a new folder using the mkdir command:
     bash
     mkdir new-folder
     
   - Add a placeholder file such as .gitkeep if the folder is meant to remain empty:
     bash
     touch new-folder/.gitkeep
     

3. *Stage the Changes*:
   - Add the new folder to the staging area:
     bash
     git add new-folder/
     

4. *Commit the Changes*:
   - Commit the changes:
     bash
     git commit -m "Add new folder"
     

5. *Push the Changes to GitHub*:
   - Push the changes to GitHub:
     bash
     git push origin main
     

After completing these steps, your folder will appear in your GitHub repository.

      bash
      git init
      git add
      git commit -m ""
      git push origin main

### The above four commands are the most basic and important commands you use most of the time for git navigation all the time.
